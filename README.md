### Contributing

Want to contribute to Citadel? Feel free!

Any development to citadel should be done to `design files` and `business logic` files. Everything else is
auto-generated, so if you make changes to these files they will disappear.

## References

### Citadel

Security Operations Micro-Services

> Citadel is a compilation of Security Operations (SecOps) microservices built with goa. 
> Each service functions independently, allowing you to use all of them or just the service that fits your needs. 
> The goal of the project is to provide a baseline set of services that a team could easily store, query, and interact with SecOps resources.

### Goa

Design First Services

> [Goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa) allows this project to be very flexible to design changes. 
> All the code and REST API documentation is generated based on the [design](./design/design.go) specification. 
> The flexibility of this comes into play in the event that a resource or service needs to be expanded upon, added, or removed without untangling anything.
